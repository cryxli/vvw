<p>Apocalypse is the boss encountered on the balcony of <location>Castle Zagore</location>, where <npc>Queen Katarina</npc> is 
usually found. As <npc>Tzar Borimir</npc> tells, Apocalypse was trapped inside the frozen cave of <location>Heart of Frost</location>
and was released to attack Castle Zagore.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<p>He is possibly the most difficult boss in the game since you are not completely geared up when you have to 
fight him and his attacks are quite diverse.</p>

<p>Use synergies: Slide into him with a <a href="../../html/weapons.htm?tome">tome</a>'s Dimension Wave then immediately 
swap to your <a href="../../html/weapons.htm?hammer">hammer</a> to deal damage based on the hammer's stats. Hammers deal 
more base damage than tomes. Second best choice would be <a href="../../html/weapons.htm?scythe">scythes</a>.</p>

<p>Kill one of his summoned aspects at a time to immobilise him. This gives you more time to do your combo attack. Also, keep the 
aspects away from you, e.g., using <power rarity="legendary">Shockwave</power> demon power.</p>

<p>You may have to stand in Apocalypse's damaging floor to deal damage to him. Therefore, prepare a
<item rarity="uncommon">Healing Potion</item> or two. The <power rarity="legendary">Diamond</power> demon 
power may add another layer or protection.</p>
